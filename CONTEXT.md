# AI Cost Optimizer - Project Context

## Origin Story

### The Problem

As a full-stack AI engineer, I faced a frustrating reality: **AI costs are unpredictable and can spiral out of control**.

What starts as $50/month can suddenly become $5,000 when you're iterating quickly or experimenting with different approaches. The problem isn't just the money‚Äîit's the **anxiety of not knowing** how much each API call costs and whether you're using the right model for the task.

**The typical workflow**:
1. Start with GPT-4 because it's good
2. Realize costs are too high
3. Switch everything to GPT-3.5
4. Quality suffers on complex tasks
5. Manually pick models based on gut feeling
6. Still overspend because you're conservative

### The Insight

**Not all prompts are created equal.**

- "What's the capital of France?" doesn't need GPT-4 Opus ($75/M tokens)
- "Design a distributed microservices architecture" probably does
- But we're paying premium prices for everything because manual selection is tedious

**Research backs this up**:
- McKinsey: 56% faster completion with AI assistants
- But developers are scared to experiment due to cost anxiety
- The solution isn't to use cheaper models‚Äîit's to use the **right** model for each task

### The Solution

**Automatic routing based on complexity analysis.**

Build a proxy that:
1. Analyzes prompt complexity (0.0-1.0 score)
2. Routes to the optimal model (free ‚Üí cheap ‚Üí medium ‚Üí premium)
3. Tracks costs in real-time
4. Enforces budgets with alerts
5. Works transparently with existing tools

## Project Type: GTME (Give This to ME)

This is a **personal learning project** that solves a real problem I face daily.

### What GTME Means

- **Scratch Your Own Itch**: Build tools you actually need
- **Learn by Doing**: Practical skills over theoretical knowledge
- **Share What Works**: Open source for others with the same problem
- **Iterate Fast**: Ship working solutions, improve based on usage
- **No Perfection Required**: Good enough to be useful is the bar

### Why This Project

**Learning Goals**:
- FastAPI and async Python patterns
- LLM provider API integration (8 different providers!)
- Cost optimization algorithms
- Docker and cloud deployment (RunPod)
- MCP protocol implementation (Claude Desktop integration)
- Production monitoring and observability

**Personal Value**:
- I want to save money on AI costs
- I want to experiment without anxiety
- I want to understand which models are actually needed
- I want data on my AI spending patterns

**Potential for Others**:
- Every AI developer faces this problem
- Existing solutions are either too complex or too limited
- Simple, practical tools often win

## Current State (October 2025)

### What's Built ‚úÖ

**Core Service** (Weeks 1-2):
- FastAPI backend with 6 REST endpoints
- Smart routing algorithm based on complexity analysis
- 8 LLM provider integrations:
  - Anthropic (Claude family)
  - Google (Gemini family)
  - Cerebras (ultra-fast Llama)
  - DeepSeek (Chinese specialist)
  - OpenRouter (gateway to 100+ models)
  - HuggingFace (open models)
  -  (local/free)
  - Cartesia (partial)
- Cost tracking with token counting
- Budget management with configurable thresholds
- Provider auto-enablement based on API keys

**Claude Desktop Integration** (Week 3):
- Full MCP server implementation
- 5 tools for Claude to use:
  - complete_prompt (smart routing)
  - check_model_costs (pricing info)
  - get_recommendation (analyze without executing)
  - query_usage (spending stats)
  - set_budget (limit enforcement)
- Intelligent error handling
- Formatted markdown responses

**Production Ready** (Week 4):
- Docker containerization
- RunPod deployment configuration
- Health check and metrics endpoints
- Structured logging (stdout + file)
- Persistent database support
- CORS middleware
- Request timing middleware

**Marketplace Package** (Week 4):
- Complete SKILL.md for Claude Desktop marketplace
- Deployment guide for RunPod
- MCP setup instructions
- Distribution ZIP file
- Ready for submission (pending icon + screenshots)

### What's Stubbed üöß

**Database Persistence**:
- SQLite configured but cost tracking uses in-memory storage
- Need to implement actual DB writes
- Schema designed, just needs implementation

**Budget Alerts**:
- Thresholds calculated correctly
- Alert conditions detected
- But no actual notification system (email, webhook, etc.)

**Usage Analytics**:
- Basic stats available via API
- But no detailed historical analysis
- No visualization or trends

### What's Missing ‚ùå

**Assets for Marketplace**:
- Icon (512x512 PNG) - need to design/generate
- Screenshots (3-5 images) - need real usage captures
- Demo video (optional but helpful)

**Testing**:
- No unit tests yet (learning project, iterating fast)
- No integration tests
- Manual testing only

**UI Dashboard**:
- Streamlit dashboard planned for v1.1
- Would show: costs over time, model usage, savings calculations
- Not blocking for MVP

**Advanced Features**:
- ML-based complexity prediction (currently heuristic)
- Response quality scoring
- A/B testing framework
- Team collaboration features

## Technical Decisions

### Why FastAPI?

- Modern Python with async/await
- Automatic OpenAPI docs
- Fast and lightweight
- Great for LLM proxies

### Why SQLite?

- Zero configuration
- Perfect for single-user/small deployments
- Easy to backup
- Can migrate to Postgres later if needed

### Why Multiple Providers?

- **Redundancy**: One provider down? Route to another
- **Cost optimization**: Cerebras is 10x cheaper than OpenAI for speed
- **Feature diversity**: Some models excel at specific tasks
- **No lock-in**: Users aren't tied to one provider

### Why MCP Protocol?

- **Claude Desktop native**: Best integration possible
- **Clean abstraction**: Protocol handles transport, we handle logic
- **Tool-based**: Natural fit for our use case
- **Future-proof**: Anthropic's supported standard

### Why RunPod?

- **Cost-effective**: CPU-only workload, $50-150/month for 24/7
- **Docker-based**: Easy deployment
- **Persistent storage**: 5GB volume for database
- **Auto-restart**: Health checks with recovery
- **Simple**: No Kubernetes complexity

## Design Principles

### 1. Cost-Aware by Default

Every decision considers cost:
- Default to cheaper models when uncertain
- Show cost breakdowns in responses
- Make savings visible to users
- Budget enforcement is built-in, not bolted-on

### 2. Transparent Routing

Users should understand **why** a model was chosen:
- Complexity score included in responses
- Model selection reasoning available
- Override options when users know better
- No black box decisions

### 3. Graceful Degradation

Things will fail, handle it well:
- Provider outages ‚Üí route to alternatives
- API key expiration ‚Üí helpful error messages
- Rate limits ‚Üí backoff and retry
- Budget exceeded ‚Üí clear notification

### 4. Smart Defaults

Minimize configuration:
- Auto-enable providers based on API keys
- Smart database path detection (local vs production)
- Reasonable budget defaults ($100/month)
- Works with one provider API key

### 5. Production Ready

Not just a prototype:
- Health checks for orchestration
- Metrics for monitoring
- Structured logging
- Request tracing
- Error handling at every layer

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

**Complexity Analysis**:
- Simple heuristic (length + keywords + code presence) works surprisingly well
- Users can understand the scoring
- Easy to debug and improve

**Provider Abstraction**:
- Common interface makes adding providers easy
- Auto-initialization based on env vars is convenient
- Each provider handles its own quirks

**MCP Integration**:
- Protocol is well-designed and easy to work with
- Tool-based approach fits perfectly
- Claude Desktop makes testing smooth

**Docker + RunPod**:
- Containerization was worth it from day one
- RunPod deployment is actually simple
- Health checks catch issues early

### What Was Hard

**Token Counting**:
- Different providers count tokens differently
- tiktoken doesn't support all models
- Had to implement provider-specific counting

**Error Handling**:
- So many ways things can fail:
  - Provider API down
  - Rate limits
  - Invalid API keys
  - Network timeouts
  - Malformed responses
- Had to be methodical about catching everything

**Cost Calculation**:
- Provider pricing changes frequently
- Different pricing for input vs output tokens
- Some models have special pricing (cached, batched, etc.)
- Need to keep pricing data updated

**Complexity Analysis**:
- Hard to calibrate the thresholds
- What's "complex" varies by domain
- Needed manual testing and adjustment
