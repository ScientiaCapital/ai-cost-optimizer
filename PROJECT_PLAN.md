# AI Cost Optimizer & Multi-LLM Router

## Project Overview
Build a cost-efficient AI routing system that automatically selects the best LLM based on task complexity, cost constraints, and performance requirements.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Cost Reduction**: 40-70% savings by routing simple tasks to cheaper models
- **Performance**: Smart routing ensures quality while minimizing spend
- **Transparency**: Real-time cost tracking and budget alerts
- **Multi-Provider**: Start with OpenRouter, expand to direct APIs

## 2-Week Launch Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-7)
**Days 1-2: Setup & OpenRouter Integration**
- Project scaffolding
- OpenRouter API integration
- Basic routing logic (complexity detection)
- Cost calculation engine

**Days 3-4: Core Features**
- Multi-model routing (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini via OpenRouter)
- Request complexity analyzer
- Cost tracking database/storage
- Basic web interface or CLI

**Days 5-7: Intelligence Layer**
- Smart routing algorithms
- Model performance tracking
- Fallback mechanisms
- Testing suite

### Week 2: Launch Prep (Days 8-14)
**Days 8-10: Budget Management**
- Budget alerts system
- Usage dashboards
- Cost analytics
- Historical tracking

**Days 11-12: Polish & Testing**
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation
- Error handling

**Days 13-14: Launch**
- Deployment setup
- User documentation
- Initial user testing
- Bug fixes

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Router Core**: Decision engine for model selection
2. **Cost Engine**: Real-time cost calculation and tracking
3. **Analytics**: Usage patterns and optimization insights
4. **Budget Manager**: Alerts and spending controls
5. **API Gateway**: Unified interface for all LLM providers

### Initial Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **Database**: SQLite (MVP) → PostgreSQL (scale)
- **Frontend**: Simple React dashboard or Streamlit
- **Integration**: OpenRouter SDK
- **Deployment**: Docker + Railway/Render

## Feature Roadmap

### MVP (Week 1-2)
- ✓ OpenRouter integration (40+ models)
- ✓ Automatic routing based on complexity
- ✓ Cost tracking per request
- ✓ Budget alerts (email/webhook)
- ✓ Simple dashboard

### Phase 2 (Week 3-4)
- Direct API integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Advanced routing (latency, quality scores)
- Team management features
- API key for external integration

### Phase 3 (Month 2)
- Custom routing rules/policies
- A/B testing framework
- Fine-grained analytics
- Multi-tenant support

## Success Metrics
- Cost savings: >50% for typical workloads
- Routing accuracy: >90%
- Response time overhead: <100ms
- User satisfaction: Easy setup (<5 min)

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement queuing and retry logic
- **Model Availability**: Automatic fallbacks
- **Cost Spikes**: Hard budget caps with circuit breakers
- **Complexity Detection**: Start simple, improve with feedback
