# AI Cost Optimizer

## üéØ Overview

**Stop overspending on AI.** The AI Cost Optimizer automatically routes your prompts to the most cost-efficient model based on task complexity, saving 40-70% on API costs while maintaining quality.

### Why This Matters

- **Developer Pain**: AI costs can escalate from $50 to $5,000/month without warning
- **Current Problem**: Manual model selection is tedious and error-prone
- **Our Solution**: Intelligent routing that uses GPT-4 only when necessary, free models when possible

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Smart Routing**: Automatically analyzes prompt complexity (0.0-1.0 score) and selects optimal model
‚úÖ **Multi-Provider**: Access 40+ models from Anthropic, Google, Cerebras, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and more
‚úÖ **Cost Tracking**: Real-time monitoring with per-request cost breakdown
‚úÖ **Budget Management**: Set limits and receive alerts at 50%, 80%, 90% thresholds
‚úÖ **Transparent Pricing**: See exact costs before and after each request
‚úÖ **Zero Lock-in**: Works with your existing API keys, no proprietary wrappers

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Deploy AI Cost Optimizer Service

The FastAPI service must be running (locally or on RunPod).

**Quick Start (Local)**:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-cost-optimizer.git
cd ai-cost-optimizer

# Setup environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure providers
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add at least one API key

# Start service
python main.py
```

Service runs at `http://localhost:8000`

**RunPod Deployment** (Recommended for production):
See [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-cost-optimizer/blob/main/DEPLOYMENT.md)

### 2. API Keys (Choose At Least One)

- **Free Option**: Google Gemini (no API key cost, 1M free requests/month)
- **Anthropic**: Claude models ($3-15/M tokens)
- **Cerebras**: Ultra-fast Llama ($0.10-0.60/M tokens)
- **DeepSeek**: Chinese LLM specialist ($0.14-0.28/M tokens)
- **OpenRouter**: Gateway to 100+ models
- **HuggingFace**: Open source models

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Install the Skill

Install from Claude Desktop Skills Marketplace or download the .zip package.

### Step 2: Configure MCP Server

Add to your Claude Desktop config:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-cost-optimizer": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/ai-cost-optimizer/mcp/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "COST_OPTIMIZER_API_URL": "http://localhost:8000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For RunPod deployment**, update the URL:
```json
"COST_OPTIMIZER_API_URL": "https://your-pod-id.runpod.io"
```

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop.

## üí° Usage

Once installed, Claude has access to 5 powerful tools:

### 1. Complete Prompt with Smart Routing

**Command**: Ask Claude to route your prompt through the optimizer

**Example**:
```
Please use the cost optimizer to answer: "What is quantum entanglement?"
```

**Response**:
```
Response: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where...

üí∞ Saved ~$0.002 vs GPT-4
```

### 2. Check Model Costs

**Command**: View all available models and pricing

**Example**:
```
Show me all available models and their costs
```

**Response**:
```

"Write a comprehensive technical architecture document for a distributed system"
```

**Response**:
```
Recommendation Analysis

- Mix of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
- Cost: ~$200/month

**With Optimizer**:
- Intelligent routing by complexity
- Cost: ~$60/month
- **Savings: $140/month (70%)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables (Service)

Configure in the AI Cost Optimizer service `.env`:

```bash
# Provider API Keys (configure at least one)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

# Budget
DEFAULT_MONTHLY_BUDGET=100.00

# Database (automatic in Docker)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./optimizer.db
```

### MCP Server Configuration

Adjust in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-cost-optimizer": {
      "env": {
        "COST_OPTIMIZER_API_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "COST_OPTIMIZER_API_KEY": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to AI Cost Optimizer service"

**Solution**: Ensure the service is running:
```bash
cd ai-cost-optimizer
python main.py
```

Verify at: `http://localhost:8000/health`

### Issue: "No providers available"

**Solution**: Add at least one API key to `.env`:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Restart the service.

### Issue: MCP server not appearing in Claude Desktop

**Solutions**:
1. Use absolute paths, not relative
2. Verify Python is in PATH
3. Check Claude Desktop logs
4. Restart Claude Desktop completely

### Issue: "Budget exceeded"

**Solution**: Increase budget or check usage:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/usage
```

Or ask Claude: "What's my current AI spending?"

## üö¢ Deployment to RunPod

For production deployment:

1. **Build Docker Image**:
```bash
docker build -t ai-cost-optimizer:latest .
docker tag ai-cost-optimizer:latest your-dockerhub-username/ai-cost-optimizer:latest
docker push your-dockerhub-username/ai-cost-optimizer:latest
```

2. **Deploy on RunPod**:
- Go to https://www.runpod.io/
