## System Requirements

### For MCP Server (Local)

- Python 3.10 or higher
- 50MB disk space
- Network access to AI Cost Optimizer API

### For FastAPI Service (Deployment)

**Local Development**:
- Python 3.10+
- 100MB disk space
- At least one LLM provider API key

**RunPod Production**:
- Docker Hub account (free)
- RunPod account (free signup)
- 2-4 vCPU, 4-8GB RAM recommended
- 5GB persistent storage
- Cost: ~$50-150/month for 24/7 operation

## Configuration

### API Keys

You'll need at least one provider API key. Options:

**Free Tier**:
- Google Gemini: 1M requests/month free

**Paid Options**:
- Anthropic Claude: $3-15/M tokens
- Cerebras: $0.10-0.60/M tokens
- DeepSeek: $0.14-0.28/M tokens
- OpenRouter: Gateway to 100+ models
- HuggingFace: Open models

Configure in the main service's `.env` file (not included in this package).

### Environment Variables

**For MCP Server** (in Claude Desktop config):
```json
"env": {
  "COST_OPTIMIZER_API_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
  "COST_OPTIMIZER_API_KEY": ""
}
```

**For FastAPI Service** (in service `.env`):
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
DEFAULT_MONTHLY_BUDGET=100.00
```

## Usage Examples

Once installed, use these commands in Claude Desktop:

### Smart Routing
```
Please use the cost optimizer to answer: "What is machine learning?"
```

### Check Costs
```
Show me all available models and their pricing
```

### Get Recommendations
```
Analyze this prompt and recommend a model:
"Design a distributed system architecture"
```

### Monitor Spending
```
What's my AI spending this month?
```

### Set Budget
```
Set my monthly AI budget to $50 with alerts at 50%, 80%, and 90%
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to AI Cost Optimizer service"

**Cause**: FastAPI service not running
**Solution**: Start the service or verify the URL in MCP config

### "MCP server not appearing in Claude Desktop"

**Causes**:
1. Incorrect path in config (must be absolute)
2. Claude Desktop not restarted
3. Python not in PATH

**Solutions**:
1. Use absolute path: `/Users/you/path/to/server.py`
2. Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop
3. Test: `python --version` in terminal

### "No providers available"

**Cause**: No API keys configured in service
**Solution**: Add at least one API key to service `.env` file
